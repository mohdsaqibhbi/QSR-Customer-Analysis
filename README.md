# QSR-Customer-Analysis

This repo is about how to do EDA on QSR Transaction and Product data, Customer Segmentation, Churn Prediction, and Channel vulnerability.

### Disclaimer
The data is more like a play data and the repo is just for fair use purposes such as learning and research.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Hands-on practice in:
    
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaborn

### Work Flow

1. [QRS_EDA](QRS_EDA.ipynb)
    
    In this [notebook](QRS_EDA.ipynb) we did the EDA on the QSR Transaction and Product data and wrote down the insights.
2. [RFM](RFM.ipynb)

    In this [notebook](RFM.ipynb) we did the customer segmentation using most popular method RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary).
3. [Churn_prediction](Churn_prediction.ipynb)

    In this [notebook](Churn_prediction.ipynb) we prepared the data for churn prediction and later, trained the model over it.
4. [Product_Affinity_analysis](Product_Affinity_analysis.ipynb)
    
    In this [notebook](Product_Affinity_analysis.ipynb) we tried to product affinity analysis by calculating the support, confidence and logic score. But as mentioned before the data wasn't good enough so couldn't reach the end goal.
